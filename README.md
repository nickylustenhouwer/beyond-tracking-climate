# Home directory
Contents:
- this README

- beyond-tracking-climate.Rproj
  -  R project file. Open this file in R studio to run all R scripts with the correct relative file paths.

- citations.txt
  - Reference list for all species occurrence data used in this project. 

# RScripts
Contents:
- LustenhouwerParker_start.R
  - Start here. This script will load the climate and species occurrence data needed to run subsequent scripts. 
  - Related figures and tables: Table 1

- LustenhouwerParker_PredictorSelection.R
  - This script shows how the climate variables were selected. It is stand-alone and does not need to be run for subsequent analyses.

- LustenhouwerParker_COUE.R
  - This script will run the COUE analyses (niche centroid shift, overlap, unfilling, and expansion).
  - Related figures and tables: Figure 1, Figure 3abde, Table 2 

- LustenhouwerParker_MaxEnt.R
  - This script will run the Maximum Entropy models.
  - Related figures and tables: Figure 2, Figure 3cf, Figure S1-4, Table 3
